# Shortest-Path-Yosemite

Shows the shortest path from one location on the given map of yosemite to the desired end location using Dijstra's Algorithm.

Includes distance and path.

Application UI is very simple, it is not meant to be pretty. This application was for me to 
further enhance and demonstrate my understanding of graphs. 

Main class in Yosemite.java
